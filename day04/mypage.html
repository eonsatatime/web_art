    <p>
      My practice is largely digital work such as photo, video, sound, 3D, AI,
      and pixel art. I am very interested in making art about alternate
      realities, dystopian futuristic worlds, video games, cyberpunk, everyone’s
      digital persona that lives on the internet, and the exploration of home
      and belonging.
    </p>

    <p>
      My interest in these themes are deeply rooted in personal struggles and
      grappling with loss of home, loved ones, love, and the self. The creation
      of my alter ego is a way of escapism and a desire to exist in a different
      reality, maybe even as a means of dissociation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I spent a lot of time thinking about how we are bound to our screens,
      being so entrenched in the digitized world that we lose touch with
      reality. The more digitized the world become, we lose real, authentic
      connection with people. Isolation, lonliness, depression, among many
      others are common issues prepetuated by the internet and social media. We
      see this so much with our generation and I think the younger generations
      progressively have it worse.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we were raised by the internet. The internet is here to stay and
      technology will continue to proliferate our world. The way the world gets
      our attention is through the screen. This may be one of the main reasons
      why I am so drawn to make work with the screen being my canvas.

    <h3> ALTER_EGO, 2023 ✧˖°</h3>

    <p>
      [The alter ego is a cyborg living in an unknown dimension in a cyberpunk
      city, looking for belonging in a world of fast-paced chaos in a heavily
      machine dominated realm. There’s a loss of human touch, familiarity, and
      comfort as you are heavily on guard as a means of self-defense making use
      of the many computer modifications done to your body, replacing the human
      flesh. What is home? Where is home? Where do I belong? Where am I wanted?
      This is a pixel art drawing with themes of dissociation, loss, and home.]

    <h2>DIGITAL_PERSONA, 2023</h2>
    <video src="digital_persona.mp4" autoplay loop muted></video>

    <p>
      [A representation of your digital persona glitching in the simulation and
      the physical form disintegrating. An exploration of our individual online
      presence, digital footprint, and cyber identity. Online avatar vs physical body. Online personality, appearance, aesthetic, lifestyle, everything vs irl. The idea of living entirely in the virtual world, virtual love, virtual friends, virtual virtual job, virtual everything. Becoming one with the machine and the internet. Pixel art drawing.]
