    HELLO :3
    practice is largely digital work such as photo, video, sound, 3D, AI, and pixel art. I am very interested in making
    art about alternate realities, dystopian futuristic worlds, video games, cyberpunk, everyone’s digital persona that
    lives on the internet, and the exploration of home and belonging.

    My interest in these themes are deeply rooted in personal struggles and grappling with loss of home, loved ones,
    love, and the self. The creation of my alter ego is a way of escapism and a desire to exist in a different reality,
    maybe even as a means of dissociation.

    I spent a lot of time thinking about how we are bound to our screens, being so entrenched in the digitized world
    that we lose touch with reality. We see this so much with my generation and I think the younger generations
    progressively have it worse. One of my videos is a commentary on how much we are controlled by our screens and the
    overstimulation and content overload.

    The way the world gets our attention is through the screen. This could be one of the reasons why I am so drawn to
    make work with the screen being my canvas.

<p>
    [The alter ego is a cyborg living in an unknown dimension in a cyberpunk city, looking for belonging in a world of fast-paced chaos in a heavily machine dominated realm. There’s a loss of human touch, familiarity, and comfort as you are heavily on guard as a means of self-defense making use of the many computer modifications done to your body, replacing the human flesh. This is a pixel drawing with themes of dissociation, loss, and home.]
